# ICEbox

ICEbox is an application for organization members to provide anonymous feedback to their leadership on ways to improve the unit. 

This was originally made to be a basic solution to solve a need a specific team within my unit had, but I've recently decided to expand its functionality for practice, if for no other reason.
